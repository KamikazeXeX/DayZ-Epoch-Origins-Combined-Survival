DayZ-Epoch-Origins-Combined-Survival
====================================

This project will not copy the DayZ Origins Mod one-to-one, nor will it provide any server files that are compatible with any regular version of the DayZ Origins mod.

The main target of this project is to improve the experience of DayZ Epoch in combination with the DayZ Origins 1.7.9 Mod.
This is better experience is gained by fixing some bugs of the current DayZ Epoch version and adding missing configurations and scripts from DayZ Origins 1.7.9.

In addition there will be a set of different predefined loottables for every need, vehicle skins and some new features.
New features will be for example a planting system and a tuning shop in which you can improve your vehicles.
