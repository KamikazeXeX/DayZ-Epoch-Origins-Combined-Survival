DayZ-Epoch-Origins-Combined-Survival
====================================

This project will not copy the DayZ Origins Mod one-to-one and neither provide Server Files, which are compatible to the unmodded Version of this Mod.

The main target of this project is to improve the experience of DayZ Epoch in combination with other Mods like the DayZ Origins Mod 1.7.9.
This is gained by fixing some bugs of the current DayZ Epoch version and adding missing configurations, scripts.

In addition there will be a set of different predefined loottables for every need, vehicle skins and some new features.
New Features will be for example a plantingsystem and a tuning shop, where you can improve your vehicles.
